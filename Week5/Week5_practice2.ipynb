            "Bot: The color of the sky can appear different depending on the time of day, atmospheric conditions, and the amount of dust and water vapor in the air. However, under normal conditions, the sky typically appears blue because of a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering.\n",
            "\n",
            "Rayleigh scattering is when shorter wavelengths of light, such as blue and violet, are scattered more than longer wavelengths, like red and orange, by tiny molecules of gases in the atmosphere, like nitrogen and oxygen. This scattering effect gives the sky its blue appearance.\n",
            "\n",
            "Here's a more detailed explanation:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. When sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere, it encounters tiny molecules of gases.\n",
            "2. The shorter wavelengths of light (blue and violet) are scattered more than the longer wavelengths (red and orange) due to their smaller size.\n",
            "3. This scattering effect distributes the blue and violet light in all directions, making it visible from our perspective on the ground.\n",
            "4. The red and orange wavelengths, which aren't scattered as much, continue to travel in a more direct path to our eyes, giving the sun its yellowish hue.\n",
            "5. As the sunlight reaches our atmosphere, the combined effect of the scattered blue light and the direct red light gives us the familiar blue sky.\n",
            "\n",
            "Keep in mind that atmospheric conditions can change the apparent color of the sky. For example:\n",
            "\n",
            "* During sunrise and sunset, the light has to travel longer distances through the atmosphere, scattering even more shorter wavelengths, making the sky appear more orange or reddish.\n",
            "* On cloudy days, the water droplets or ice crystals in clouds can scatter light differently, giving the sky a whiter or grayer appearance.\n",
            "* At high altitudes or during space missions, the lack of atmospheric gases can make the sky appear darker and more black.\n",
            "\n",
