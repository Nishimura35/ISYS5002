        "\n",
        "In this project, you will build a simple User Preferences Survey using Python. This project collates many of the exercises from this week’s activities. This is intentional—by combining these exercises, you can reflect on your progress and see how well you’re following the industry best practices we espouse. These practices include:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Meaningful Notebook Naming:** Give your notebook a clear, descriptive name (e.g., `user_preferences_survey.ipynb`).\n",
        "- **Frequent Saves & Version Control:** Save your work often and use descriptive commit messages when uploading to GitHub.\n",
        "- **Descriptive Variable Names:** Use names like `user_name`, `fav_colour`, etc., to clearly convey their purpose.\n",
        "- **Code Comments & Documentation:** Use text cells and inline comments to document your thought process.\n",
        "- **Critical Use of AI:** Ask follow-up questions if anything is unclear, and verify that AI suggestions align with the basics you’ve learned (i.e., using input(), print(), basic data types, and variables).\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's get started!\n",

        "\n",
        "## Project Overview and Instructions\n",
        "\n",
        "In this project, you'll create a programme that:\n",
        "1. **Collects User Preferences:**  \n",
        "   Ask for the user's name, favourite colour, favourite food, and favourite hobby.\n",
        "2. **Displays a Personalized Summary:**  \n",
        "   Outputs a clear summary message using the collected data.\n",
        "3. **Follows Industry Best Practices:**  \n",
        "   Emphasises meaningful variable names, proper documentation, and good version control.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Project Steps:**\n",
        "1. **State the Problem**  \n",
        "2. **Describe Input and Output**  \n",
        "3. **Work the Problem by Hand**  \n",
        "4. **Develop an Algorithm (Pseudocode)**  \n",
        "5. **Write the Code**  \n",
        "6. **Reflect on Best Practices & Use AI to Verify**\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "## Step 1 – State the Problem\n",
        "\n",
        "Define the goal of your programme in your own words. For example:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Goal:** Build a programme that collects a user's preferences and displays a personalized summary.\n",
        "- **Data to Gather:** User's name, favourite colour, favourite food, and favourite hobby.\n",
        "\n",
        "**AI Usage Tip:**  \n",
        "If you're unsure whether your problem statement is clear, ask an AI tool:  \n",

        "- `fav_colour` (string)\n",
        "- `fav_food` (string)\n",
        "- `fav_hobby` (string)\n",
        "\n",
        "**Expected Output:**  \n",
        "A message like:  \n",
        "> \"Hello, [user_name]! Your favourite colour is [fav_colour], you love [fav_food], and you enjoy [fav_hobby].\"\n",
        "\n",
        "**AI Usage Tip:**  \n",

        "## Step 3 – Work the Problem by Hand\n",

        "- `fav_food` = \"pizza\"\n",
        "- `fav_hobby` = \"reading\"\n",

        "\n",
        "Try a few scenarios on paper to confirm your expectations.\n",

        "\n",
        "## Step 4 – Develop an Algorithm (Pseudocode)\n",
        "\n",
        "Outline your approach using pseudocode. For example:\n",
        "\n",
        "```plain\n",
        "1. Start the program.\n",
        "2. Prompt the user for their name and store it.\n",
        "3. Prompt for favourite colour and store it.\n",
        "4. Prompt for favourite food and store it.\n",
        "5. Prompt for favourite hobby and store it.\n",
        "6. Construct a summary message using these inputs.\n",
        "7. Print the summary message.\n",
        "8. End the program.\n",

        "\n",
        "**AI Usage Tip:**  \n",
