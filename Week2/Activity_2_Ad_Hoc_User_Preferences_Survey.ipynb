        "Explore how to gather and display user preferences through an open-ended programming task. This activity encourages experimentation and resourcefulness with the concepts of input and output in Python.\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Write a Python Script:**  \n",

        "\n",
        "2. **Gather Preferences:**  \n",
        "   - Choose at least three different preferences to ask the user about (for example, favourite colour, favourite food, favourite hobby, favourite movie, etc.).\n",
        "   - Use the `input()` function to capture the user’s responses.\n",
        "  \n",
        "3. **Present Preferences:**  \n",
        "   - Use the `print()` function to display the gathered preferences in a clear and organised manner.\n",
        "   - Consider constructing a summary message that incorporates the user’s inputs, for example:  \n",
