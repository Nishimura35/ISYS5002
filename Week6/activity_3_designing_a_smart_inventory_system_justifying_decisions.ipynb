        "\n",
        "By the end of this activity, you will be able to:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Analyse the strengths and limitations of using a dictionary-powered approach for an inventory management system.\n",
        "- Evaluate the suitability of different inventory management strategies for a given business scenario.\n",
        "- Justify the design choices you make when implementing a dictionary-powered inventory system.\n",
        "- Compare and contrast various data structures and techniques for efficient inventory tracking.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "Effective inventory management is crucial for businesses to maintain optimal stock levels, minimise waste, and ensure product availability. In this activity, you will explore how to design a dictionary-powered inventory management system and learn to justify the decisions you make throughout the process. By developing this skill, you'll be better equipped to tackle complex, real-world inventory challenges that require critical thinking and problem-solving.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Using AI Tools Ethically & Effectively\n",
        "\n",
        "As you work through this activity, you may find it helpful to use AI tools, such as language models, to assist with tasks like brainstorming, explaining concepts, or generating code. However, it's important to use these tools responsibly and critically.\n",
        "\n",
        "When using AI, always be transparent about your use of the tool, and carefully evaluate the output to ensure it is accurate and aligned with the specific requirements of the task. Treat the AI as a learning partner, not a black box solution.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, you could ask an AI system: \"What are the potential limitations of using a dictionary-based approach for an inventory management system, and how might those limitations be addressed?\" Then, critically examine the AI's response and consider how it applies to your specific scenario.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Key Concepts\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Dictionary Data Structure**: A key-value store that allows for efficient storage and retrieval of inventory data.\n",
        "- **Inventory Tracking**: The process of monitoring and managing the stock levels of goods or materials.\n",
        "- **Inventory Management Strategies**: Approaches to optimising inventory levels, such as just-in-time (JIT) or economic order quantity (EOQ).\n",
        "- **Inventory Reporting**: Generating reports to track inventory levels, usage, and trends.\n",
        "- **Data Structures for Inventory**: Comparing the suitability of different data structures (e.g., lists, dictionaries, sets) for inventory management tasks.\n",
        "\n",

        "- What potential challenges or limitations might you encounter when using a dictionary for inventory management, and how would you address them?\n",
