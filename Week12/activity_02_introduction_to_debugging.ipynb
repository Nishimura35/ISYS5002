        "By the end of this activity, you will be able to:\n",
        "- Identify and rectify common syntax, runtime, and logical errors in Python code.\n",
        "- **Utilise print statements and basic logging for program tracing and error identification.**\n",
        "- **Understand the role of AI tools as assistants in the debugging process and apply them ethically.**\n",
        "- **Begin to explore the use of debugger tools like breakpoints (conceptual introduction).**\n",
        "- Develop analytical skills to understand error messages and improve faulty code.\n",

        "## Introduction\n",
        "Writing code is an act of creation, and like any creative process, it often involves a bit of trial and error! Debugging – the art of finding and fixing errors – is a fundamental skill for any programmer. This activity will introduce you to common error types, foundational debugging techniques, and how modern AI tools can assist you in becoming a more effective \"Code Detective.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "## Key Concepts\n",
        "- **Syntax Errors**: Mistakes in the code's grammar that prevent the Python interpreter from understanding it (e.g., typos, missing colons). The program won't run.\n",
        "- **Runtime Errors**: Errors that occur *while* the program is running, often due to unexpected situations (e.g., trying to divide by zero, accessing a file that doesn't exist). The program starts but then crashes.\n",
        "- **Logical Errors**: The trickiest kind! The program runs without crashing, but it doesn't do what you intended, producing incorrect results or unexpected behaviour.\n",

        "- The *file and line number* where the error occurred.\n",
